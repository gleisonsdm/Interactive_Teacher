# Interactive Teacher
This software goal is to support studying foreign languages with Google Cloud APIs.

## Proposed Workflow

### First step
- Upload a text in the language the person wants to learn.
- Whenever the algorithm parser a noun, verb, or adjective, highlight it. It also will show a picture of the selected word and its translated version with a link to the Wikipedia document.

### Second step
- Create activities based on the text automatically, such as connecting words (present in the text) with images.
- Translates the speaking into words and shows the respective images for pronunciation training.
- Spell the word based on a picture, the user selects a picture, and it automatically spells the word associated with it.
- Sort a noun present in the text, then creates a Hunting Words game with this word synonyms.

### Third step
- Select some texts and books for people to use without cost.
- Create an exam to rank people due to their skills.
- Suggest a personalized collection of books to improve personal skills.

### Fourth step
- Allow a video chat to train to speak online.
- Transform speak into text.
- Translate the text to the listener's language.
- Allow the listener to hear in his language or the original audio.
- Shows the text in a chat, in your language, and the translated version.
