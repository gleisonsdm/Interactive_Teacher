# Interactive Teacher
A project to help people to learn other languages using technology.

## Proposed Workflow

### First step
- Upload a text in the language the person wants to learn.
- Whenever the algorithm parser a substantive or adjective, highlight it.
Then, show a picture of it, and the translated word besides. Also shows a link to the wikipedia, if any.

### Second step
- Create some activities based on the text automatically, such as conect words (present in the text) with images.
- Translates the speaking into words, and show the pictures, to spell training.
- Spell the word based on a picture, the user select a picture, and it automatically spells the word associated with it.

### Third step
- Select some texts and books to people use for free.
- Create an exam to rank people due to their skills.
- Sugest a collection of books, in order to improve the person skills.
